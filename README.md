  description: SSF estimates scattering coefficient and asymmetry parameter for dielectric particulate medium. Transport scattering coefficient is the proper metric for representing scattering regime. Solution of Maxwell’s equations is possible for finite sized particulate media. Coherent scattering leads to overestimation of scattering coefficient. Calculated asymmetry parameter depends on considered ensemble size.

Category should be labeled as "student" for all members, excluding the principal investigator. If an social media link is absent, then the relevant line can be deleted or the value after the key can be left empty, as provided in the example above for GitHub section. When the "interests" part is completely deleted, the program will understand this situation via a conditional statement, and research interests will not be visible to the end-user.
