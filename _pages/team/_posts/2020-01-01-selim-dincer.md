education:
- PhD in Mechanical Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey (ongoing)
- MS in Mechanical Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey (2022)
- "MS Thesis: Radiative heat transfer modeling of cavities with inhomogeneous participating media using Monte Carlo Ray Tracing Method"
- BS in Mechanical Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey (2017)
interests:
- Monte Carlo Method
- Radiative heat transfer
- Infrared signature modeling
- Spectral modeling of participating gases
notes:
- "My current project is about the development of a Monte Carlo ray-tracing solver with a machine learning- based participating gas spectral model to simulate the radiative heat transfer in three-dimensional enclosures represented by an unstructured grid. Several machine learning methods, such as Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Light Gradient-Boosting (LightGBM), are utilized to predict the spectral radiative properties of participating gases."
