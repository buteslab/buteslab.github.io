education:
- PhD in Mechanical Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey (ongoing)
- MS in Mechanical Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey (2022)
- "MS Thesis: Plasmonic absorption enhancement via coupling effects between dielectric-plasmonic particles"
- BS in Mechanical Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey (2019)
interests:
- Near field radiative heat transfer
- Nanoplasmonics
- Computational radiative simulations
notes:
- Currently, I am expanding the applicability of the thermal discrete dipole approximation method, a stochastic Maxwell equations solver specializing in particles with irregular shapes, to include the interactions between finite-sized particles and surfaces.
