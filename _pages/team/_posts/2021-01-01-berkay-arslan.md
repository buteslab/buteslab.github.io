- Computational fluid dynamics
notes:
- I am working on Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) flow effect on heat transfer performance. Specifically, working on electric motor cooling by using ferromagnetic nanofluids. The aim of the project is to see how much heat transfer can be enhanced by  already existing magnetic field in electric motors. By doing that, what extent we can enhance lifetime of the motor. In addition, I am searching for the most suitable cooling system design to get benefits of MHD effects.
